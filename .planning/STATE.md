# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-19)

**Core value:** PlayStation games behave as they do on the console, identically on every platform, from a small MIT-licensed C library that any host can embed.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — A test frame in RetroArch

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (A test frame in RetroArch) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 15
Status: Executing Phase 01
Last activity: 2026-10-19 — Phase 01 execution started

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (full list: `.planning/preparation/DECISIONS.md`).
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Six phases, one per requirement category, kept despite the `coarse` granularity because each category is one branch, one pull request and one release.
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 is the content-free walking skeleton ported from cogmaster and muhtari; every later phase ends in an automated release.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 4]: Research flag: GPU blend width, size rejection, stepper precision, GPU clocks per line, and the adapter's stub-kernel path for PS-EXE content in RetroArch.
- [Phase 6]: Research flag: the CD seek model and INT1 period, and whether OpenBIOS boots the own mkpsxiso disc without licence data.
