# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-19)

**Core value:** PlayStation games behave as they do on the console, identically on every platform, from a small MIT-licensed C library that any host can embed.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — A test frame in RetroArch

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (A test frame in RetroArch) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 15
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-10-19 — Phase 01 execution started

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (full list: `.planning/preparation/DECISIONS.md`).
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Six phases, one per requirement category, kept despite the `coarse` granularity because each category is one branch, one pull request and one release.
- [Roadmap]: Phase 1 is the content-free walking skeleton ported from cogmaster and muhtari; every later phase ends in an automated release.
- [Phase 01]: schway_video is 80 + 2P bytes with trailing reserved1; schway_audio 16 + 2P; schway_config has reserved0 so the allocator sits at offset 8 on every target
- [Phase 01]: State header is 20 bytes (magic, format, total size, body CRC-32); the profile lock is set by the first run_frame and survives reset and load
- [Phase 01]: PROVENANCE PV.11 keeps the old cogmaster pin as a historical citation; seed pins moved to v0.1.0 f09ac97096ac

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 4]: Research flag: GPU blend width, size rejection, stepper precision, GPU clocks per line, and the adapter's stub-kernel path for PS-EXE content in RetroArch.
- [Phase 6]: Research flag: the CD seek model and INT1 period, and whether OpenBIOS boots the own mkpsxiso disc without licence data.
